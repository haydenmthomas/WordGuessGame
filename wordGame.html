    Description:

    You will need to create the embedded JavaScript necessary for a user to play your game. 
    Keep everything in this one file. The purpose of the game is to randomly choose a song 
    from a pre-defined list of 1980's songs (like hangman). Here is the global array you can use: 
    // This array contains the songs with spaces removed 
    let asSongs = ["rocklobster", "peoplearepeople", "onceinalifetime", "sweetdreams", 
    "missionaryman", "safetydance", "onlyalad", "whipit", "99redballoons"];

    This program should have a Person class that has a firstName, lastName, and age attribute. 
    It should also have a constructor that allows the user to pass it the first and last name. 
    Remember, you might never assign data to an attribute in a class but it is still part of the class.

    The program should also have a Contestant class that is inherited from the Person class. 
    It has the numberOfGamesPlayed attribute (int) and totalNumberOfGuesses. It also has a 
    gamesPlayed attribute which keep track of all of the games played (this will be an array 
    of GamesPlayed objects). The Contestant class should have a constructor that receives the 
    parent's attributes and loads them properly as we have learned in OOP, and then initialize 
    the numberOfGamesPlayed, totalNumberOfGuesses, and the gamesPlayed attributes. The Contestant 
    class should also have a method called showResults that returns a message with the first 
    and last name concatenated along with the number of guesses any completed games. 
    Only return that data if the game was completed. Otherwise if they have played a 
    game but have not completed any games, return the message first and last name 
    concatenated " has not finished a game". Otherwise if they have played a game and 
    finished it, then the method returns a string like:

    Greg Anderson has made 235 guesses
    Gina Anderson has not finished a game

    where the name was retrieved by calling a method in the Contestant class called 
    getFullName which returned the concatenated firstName and lastName attributes.
    The showResults method then concatenates " has made " and the guessCount 
    (from the completed games) from the array of gamesPlayed attribute (objects of GamesPlayed) 
    and " guesses". Do NOT USE THE totalNumberOfGuesses since this could include unfinished games.

    Or if they have not finished a game then the method calls the fullName method 
    along with " has not finished a game". Make sure the message is bolded by dynamically 
    building that into the string. This information might never be called the but 
    showResults method needs to exist in the Contestant class. The program should 
    use a global variable that is an array of Contestant objects. This array would hold 
    each contestant and the games that they have played. It can hold multiple contestants 
    who have played 0 to many games.

    If the user clicks on the Reset Form button the code should clear out the localStorage, 
    the global array of Contestant objects, reload the available characters string 
    ("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789") and clear out the used characters string (""). 
    NOTE: DO NOT USE THE onclick name of RESET.

    Call the function ResetMe. This function should make the screen look like it does 
    when it is first displayed and no game has been played.

    The GamesPlayed class has the guessCount (int) and the finishedGame (boolean) attributes. 
    When the GamesPlayed object is created the constructor does NOT receive parameters 
    but should set the guessCount to 0 and the finishedGame should be set to false. NOTE: 
    When calling the Contestant showResults method, you should only count those games 
    where the finishedGame attribute value is true for the message fullname has made 
    # guesses. (i.e. Greg Anderson has made 235 guesses)

    When the screen is first displayed, you should not see many items from the html page. 
    Once you click on the Play Game button the user MUST enter the first and then the 
    last name using a prompt. You will create the Contestant object and add it to the 
    global array of uses. Then the Play Game button should disappear and p tags 
    displayTitleName (currently underscores for each letter in the title until letters are guessed) 
    and titleNote should be displayed along with all of the field sets for the available 
    characters, used characters, and the fieldset controlling the guesses. When the user 
    clicks on the Play Game button, the playGame function will be called.

    NOTE: You will have to write event handlers for your buttons and attach them to the 
    associated button. The Play Game function should: Get the player's first name 
    and last name from prompts and create a new contestant object and assign it to the global array. 
    They MUST enter a first name and a last name. Do not let them out of the prompt unless 
    there is a value for first and last. Store this object along with all other contestants 
    in the global array called aoContestants.

    You will also keep track of the letters of the alphabet you can use and another string 
    to keep track of which letters have been used.

    Generate a random number and use this to extract a song title to solve from the array asSongs

    Generate and display the title for the displayTitleName with underscores in the place 
    of characters (i.e. _________ )

    For example, whipit would be 6 underscores next to each other without spaces

    Make sure you are showing the displayTitleName, titleNote, fsPlay, fsAvailable, and fsUsed 
    ieldset html objects in the html file. The cursor should then be programmatically placed 
    in the input text area called inputLetter. NOTE: This input should only allow 1 character 
    to be typed. When the user clicks on the btnGuess you should: Check to see if the letter 
    they typed is available to choose from the letters in the alphabet which have not been used. 
    If the letter is available check to see if the letter is in the title name. Remember that 
    case does not matter! If you found the letter in the title and you haven’t already 
    used that letter, fill in the underscore title with the letter found and remove it from 
    the letters used array and add it to the letters used array. Order of the used 
    letters does not matter.

    Display the available letters in the correct p tag and the used letters in the correct 
    p tag. For example, if they just entered in a single character check to see if that 
    character is in the title and if so, display all occurrences of that letter (i.e. __A___A___).

    Display the character(s) as uppercase and increment the guess counter for that user. 
    As they choose letters/numbers remove them from the letters available and add them to 
    the letters/numbers used and increment the guess counter. If they try to use a 
    letter already used, display a message (alert) but do not increment guess counter. 
    If they choose a letter that is not A-Z or 0-9 then display a message (alert) saying 
    it is invalid and do not increment the counter. The letters/numbers used and available 
    etters/numbers should be displayed as bold (do not change the original HTML tag. 
    Instead, do this dynamically through the use of JavaScript)

    After they choose a letter/number, set the focus back to the input area by highlighting 
    the character or data inside of that input. This can be done with the select() method. 
    Then check to see if they won the game by answering all of the letters (You will need 
    to write the checkWin function NOT A METHOD)

    The checkWin function should see if there are any more letters/numbers in the song title 
    that have not been displayed. If all of the letters have been displayed and the guess 
    count is less than 26 then show the message (alert) "You Solved it with # of guesses!" 
    (where # is the number of guesses it took) Otherwise show the message (alert) 
    "You took too many guesses". If the game is over, this function should update the 
    Contestant and GamesPlayed objects in the array by updating the totalNumberOfGuesses 
    (keeps a running total for all games), finishedGame to true (for the current game, 
    and increment numberOfGamesPlayed attributes. Also, clear out the input and reset the 
    display for the available and used characters.

    Then the function should hide the fsAvailable, fsUsed, and fsPlay fieldsets and display 
    the Play Again with SAME user button and the Play Again with DIFFERENT user button.

    If they click on the Play Again with SAME user button then call the playAgain function 
    which does everything the playGame function does BUT DOES NOT prompt or create a new user.

    If they click on the Play Again with DIFFERENT user You will just call the playGame function.

    If they clicked on the Final Guess button you would check to see what they typed in 
    the finalGuess input and see if it matched the whole song title (case doesn’t matter). 
    If they get it right, add one to the guess counter. If they did not, add 26 to the guess 
    counter. Update the objects.

    You need to keep track of each game played for each user. You will create a GamesPlayed 
    object for each game and add that to the Contestant's array of games. You will use this 
    object to keep track of the number of guesses for each game and whether the game was 
    completed. You will also continue to update the total number of guesses for each user 
    as the finish the games.

    If the user clicks on the Show Games button then the program should call the showGames 
    function. This function will sort the global array that contains all of the data based 
    upon the user’s total number of guesses for all the games. We want to see who has guessed 
    the most.

    The data should be sorted in descending order by number of totalNumberOfGuesses (we don’t 
    care if they did not finish the game). Then store that sorted array to the local storage 
    and open a new window called gameOutput.html In the gameOutput.html file that you will 
    need to create, you will display the sorted data. You can decide how you want to sort the 
    data but it has to be readable and understandable. IOW, you have to process thru the 
    local storage and make it look somewhat nice.

    You will need to display the full name along with the number of games and the 
    total number of guesses.

    Greg Anderson 454 guesses
    Gina Anderson 249 guesses
    Miles Anderson 15 guesses

    Make sure you follow the directions!

    NOTES: Make sure you handle whether the user types in a upper or lower case character 
    (they should be treated the same)

    Make sure you put appropriate comments Make sure you use appropriate variable naming

    Make sure you use appropriate OOP structured programming as learned in our course.

    When you have finished the program copy your code from BOTH files and paste it here in 
    the answer area
